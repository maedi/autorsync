Automatically runs rsync on directories from local directories to a remote ones. Currently
only works on Mac OS X (uses ruby-fsevent to detect file changes).

Usage:
  gem install ruby-fsevent
  autorsync.rb <config>

Configuration file format is in autorsync.conf.example.

It's advisable to use this with ssh muxing as setting up a new ssh connection is costly.
Put this into your .ssh/config and keep a separate ssh connection open to the host:
Host *
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath /home/<username>/.ssh/sockets/%h-%p-%r
